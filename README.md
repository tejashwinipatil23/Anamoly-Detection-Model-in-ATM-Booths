Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have become essential components of modern banking infrastructure, providing customers with convenient access to cash and financial services. However, the increasing prevalence of ATM-related crimes, including theft and vandalism, has highlighted significant vulnerabilities in their security systems. This project proposes an Anomaly Detection Model for Enhanced ATM Security Monitoring Using Machine Learning, aiming to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to improve the security of ATM operations. The proposed model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  to analyze video feeds from ATMs. By training on both normal and abnormal behavior datasets, the system can accurately identify potentially suspicious activities. This dual dataset approach enhances the model's precision, significantly reducing false positives while ensuring timely alerts for security personnel.

This project successfully integrates machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to create a robust security framework. By analyzing video feeds and behavioral patterns, the model not only enhances the detection of anomalies but also provide alert notifications and reduces false positives. Our project builds upon the success of our previous endeavor, which achieved an impressive 93.5% accuracy. We are thrilled to report that our current project has surpassed this benchmark, yielding an outstanding 98.53% accuracy.
